# Task: [Task Name]

Metadata:
- Dependencies: task-01 → Deliverable: docs/plans/analysis/research-results.md
- Provides: docs/plans/analysis/api-spec.md (for research/design tasks)
- Size: Small (1-2 files)

## Implementation Content
[What this task will achieve]
*Reference dependency deliverables if applicable

## Target Files
- [ ] [Implementation file path]
- [ ] [Test file path]

These paths define the executor's File Scope Constraint. A file absent here cannot be modified without escalation, so list every file the task touches — implementation and test alike.

## Investigation Targets
Files to read before starting implementation (file path, with optional search hint):
- [e.g., src/orders/checkout (processOrder function) — determined during task decomposition based on task nature]

## Change Category
(Include only when the task is a bug fix, regression, state change, or boundary change — populated during task decomposition. Omit otherwise.)

`Change Category: <one or more of bug-fix, regression, state-change, boundary-change — comma-separated>`

When present, the executor sweeps cases sharing the same path, contract, persisted state, or external boundary for the same class of defect. A defect rarely occurs alone; this field is what triggers the search for its siblings.

## Binding Decisions
(Include when the work plan's ADR Bindings table covers this task. Omit otherwise.)

Each row is an ADR decision this task's implementation must comply with.

| Source | Axis | Decision | Compliance Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| [docs/adr/ADR-XXXX.md (§ Decision or § Implementation Guidance), matching the work plan row] | [Axis copied verbatim from the work plan's ADR Bindings row] | [Binding decision copied from the work plan row] | [Y/N-answerable positive predicate evaluating whether the implementation satisfies the decision] |

The Compliance Check must be answerable `Y` or `N` against a concrete implementation. "Follows the ADR" is not a check; "persists the order total in minor units as an integer" is.

## Reference Contracts
(Include when the work plan's Reference Contract Values table covers this task. Omit otherwise.)

Each row is a Design-Doc-derived observable contract this task must reproduce **exactly**. Paraphrase loses the contract — copy the required value verbatim.

| Source | Contract Type | Required Observable Value | Compliance Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Design Doc path (§ Section), copied from the matching work plan row] | [structure-order / derived-display / state-lifecycle-negative] | [Required Observable Value copied verbatim from the work plan row] | [Y/N-answerable positive predicate evaluating whether the implementation reproduces the value] |

## Decisions and Unresolved Items
(Include when task decomposition resolved an alternative, optional behavior, or placeholder, or when a required decision remains unresolved. Omit when the task carries neither.)

Resolved decisions — each alternative or placeholder the decomposition fixed to an explicit choice:

| Item | Decision | Source / Rule |
|---|---|---|
| [the alternative, optional behavior, or placeholder] | [the selected choice, or the deterministic rule that selects it; for a placeholder, the exact temporary output, allowed dependencies, and verification expectation] | [work plan / Design Doc / UXRD / ADR section, or the basis of the decision rule] |

Blocking unresolved items — decisions that cannot be made at decomposition time and block execution:

| Item | Required Input | Escalation Condition |
|---|---|---|
| [the unresolved decision] | [the input needed to resolve it] | [who or what to escalate to, and the point at which the executor must stop rather than guess] |

## Investigation Notes
(Implementation observations are appended here before implementation begins. When Binding Decisions or Reference Contracts exist, record the planned approach and each Compliance Check result here — the Exit Gate re-reads them against the final implementation.)

## Implementation Steps (TDD: Red-Green-Refactor)
### 1. Red Phase
- [ ] Read all Investigation Targets and record key observations
- [ ] (When Change Category is set) Sweep adjacent cases sharing the same path/contract/state/boundary for the same class of defect; fold any found within Target Files scope into the failing tests
- [ ] Review dependency deliverables (if any)
- [ ] Verify/create contract definitions
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Run tests and confirm failure

### 2. Green Phase
- [ ] Add minimal implementation to pass tests
- [ ] Run only added tests and confirm they pass

### 3. Refactor Phase
- [ ] Improve code (maintain passing tests)
- [ ] Confirm added tests still pass

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms
(From the work plan header — mechanisms relevant to this task's target files)
- [Tool/check name] — Enforces: [what] — Config/Source: [path] — Type: `executable_check` | `passive_constraint`

## Operation Verification Methods
(Derived from the Verification Strategy in the work plan)
- **Verification method**: [what to verify and how — e.g. "compare new implementation output against src/legacy/order_calc", "run endpoint against test database and verify response matches contract"]
- **Success criteria**: [observable outcome proving correctness — e.g. "output matches the existing implementation for all input combinations", "API returns 200 with the expected schema"]
- **Failure response**: [what to do if verification fails — e.g. "reassess approach before proceeding", "escalate to user"]
- **Verification level**: [L1: functional operation as end-user feature / L2: new tests added and passing / L3: code builds without errors]

## Proof Obligations
(One entry per AC, claim, or applicable Failure Mode Checklist category this task covers. A passing test proves nothing unless it would fail for a named reason — that reason is the primary failure mode. Repeat the block once per claim; the heading carries the AC ID, claim ID, or `Failure Mode: <category>` so downstream review can resolve coverage per claim.)

### Obligation: [AC ID, claim ID, or Failure Mode category — e.g. `Failure Mode: missing-sort-key ordering`]
- **Claim**: [the AC behavior, claim, or failure-mode condition this task must prove]
- **Primary failure mode**: [the regression the test turns red on]
- **Boundary to exercise**: [public/integration boundary the test traverses, or "in-process unit"]
- **State assertion**: [observable state before → action → after for state-changing claims; "N/A" otherwise]
- **Mock boundary rationale**: [which boundaries may be mocked and why; "none" when all real]
- **Residual**: [what this proof leaves unestablished, if any]

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All added tests pass, and the run is substantive (no always-true assertions, no 0-match runner reports, no skipped tests on the running path)
- [ ] Operation verified per Operation Verification Methods above
- [ ] Each Proof Obligation is met: the test turns red under its primary failure mode and exercises the stated boundary
- [ ] Deliverables created (for research/design tasks)
- [ ] (When Binding Decisions exist) Every Compliance Check evaluates to `Y` against the **final** implementation, with evidence recorded in Investigation Notes (file:line, test result, or command output)
- [ ] (When Reference Contracts exist) Every Compliance Check evaluates to `Y` against the **final** implementation, with evidence in Investigation Notes
- [ ] (When Decisions and Unresolved Items exist) Every resolved decision is applied as recorded, and no blocking unresolved item remains open — if one does, execution halts and escalates per its Escalation Condition

## Notes
- Impact scope: [Areas where changes may propagate]
- Scope boundary: [Files to preserve unchanged — path and reason]
